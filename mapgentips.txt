Or what I learned from watching flux graphs of various songs:

Drums are the most energetic instruments, therefore they generate most of the peaks (duh). In electronic music songs, the part where the background
should "bathe in colors" or have the most colorful palette are the parts where there are no "drums" aka visible peaks yet the energy is very high.
These parts are usually meant to be enjoyable so the color scheme could be relaxing (or very unrelaxing if the flux fluctuates rapidly) but easy to
play through.

Energy affects peak detection A LOT. If there's a lot of energy the same volume drum hits won't register as peaks anymore because the multiplier
isn't reached.
